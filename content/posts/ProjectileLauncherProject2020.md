# Projectile Launcher Project


## Resource Plan 
- 3d Printed functional parts 
- Twine/string
- Marble as projectile.
- Apple as effort weight
-  3mm/5mm bolt & nuts
- crayons to help balance
-  Wood to build structure

## Build list 
- 2 m3 bolts&nuts
- 3d printer and ~300g of filament
- roll of twine
- 2 m5 bolts&nuts 
- 2 3.5ft 2x4 wood boards
-  2 roughly 1ftx2-3ft pieces of plywood 
- 3d printable parts can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4630483)
- 3 wood screws
## Instructions
### Wood Structure & Pulley System
1: 3d print all files listed in thingiverse link

2: Assemble Pulleys

3: Assemble wood structure according to image below 

4: Insert 1 wood screw in the middle of the top piece of plywood(this is where the pulley will hang from)

5: Insert 1 wood screw on the far edge of the plywood (this is where the twine will hang from) then attach twine to screw.

6: Insert 1 wood screw into apple and use twine to attach apple to loop of pulley

7: Attach last pulley to screw that was placed in middle of top board

8: Thread twine that was attached to screw through both pulleys


### Launcher
1: Take both arm parts and screw them together with the provided holes 

2: Place arm in between holes on launcher base

3: Place 3d printed rod through the base holes and the arm 

4: Use 2 m3 bolts & nuts to keep rod from sliding out

5: Use weights of your choice to balance arm 

### Usage 
1: Once arm is weighted then place projectile in box

2: Arrange launcher under where the weight will be dropped

3: Hoist weight with twine

4: Drop weight to launch projectile.

## Calculations
### 1st Class Lever IMA
$$
(210m/205mm)= IMA = 1.02439
$$
### 2:1 Pulley IMA
IMA= 2 `(# of strings. The string I am pulling does not count because I am pulling down)`

### Combined IMA

$$IMA{_{LEVER}}= 1.02439$$

$$IMA{_{PULLEY}}= 2$$

$$IMA{_{TOTAL}}= IMA(LEVER) * IMA(PULLEY)$$

$$IMA{_{TOTAL}}= 2.04878$$

## Modifications

Over all the machine worked "well" but there are a few things I would change.
1. Add a way to hold the string (a screw in the wood to tie the screw to)
2. Fix tolerances between the pulls `string would occasionally fall in the gap between the pulley wheel and pulley enclosure `
3. Have a better weight system than some crayons tapped to the launcher arm
4. Move the top platform holding the 1st pulley wheel up back about 10cm.`the 2 occasions where the marble would only go ~2ft was because it hit the top platform and bounced off)`
