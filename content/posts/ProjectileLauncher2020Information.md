# Projectile Launcher Project 2020

Task: Design and build a device to launch a projectile of your choosing to the maximum possible horizontal distance (range), utilizing simple machines and mechanisms to create a compound machine.

**Constraints:**
-   Compound machine must consist of at least 2 consecutive simple machines or mechanisms
    
-   No items may be purchased for the completion of this project - you may only use objects you can find at home.
    
-   Teams will measure relevant values and calculate the overall Ideal Mechanical Advantage of the compound machine in their documentation.
    
-   The only allowed human input is a force initializing the starting machine (launch trigger).

***Submission Details:***

**Criterion C Interview/Documentation Deadline - During Class 10/26 or 10/27**

-   During this interview, you will answer questions and present evidence related to Creating the Solution.
    
-   Finished products must be ready for testing at the start of class on Thursday/Friday 10/22 or 10/23.
    

Evidence presented in the interview will be assessed with the [MYP Design Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-9PZ8aww4YwMQhLRJwwYdkxzZLpj0xXsILknqLURBkE/edit?usp=sharing) (Criterion C).

**Documentation/Evidence Checklist (have this ready for your Interview, and submit in Schoology):**

-   Time Management Plan (Gantt Chart, Daily task list, etc.)
    
-   Resource Plan (materials list)
    
-   Photos/Videos of working device
    
-   Measurement/Calculations:
    

-   List/sketch the 2 simple machines used
    
-   Measurements for each machine (Effort Distance and Resistance Distance)
    
-   Ideal Mechanical Advantage Calculation
    

-   Modifications list (with sketches/images and reason for modification)
    
-   Testing Data (10+ trials, launch range)
